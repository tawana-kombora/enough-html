# Learn Enough Web Technologies To Be \#Dangerous
<!-- picture of an ouroboros -->
Another repository, another promise to myself that I'll get the foundations down properly.

I've had this problem for the last **7 months**: I pick up some new technology off of a youtube tech influencers opinion about what's "hot" in tech currently and what will consequently get you a **job**.

I've been learning in a haphazard manner, but as you can imagine, it hasn't worked out. Working out meaning I come away with tangible work and confidence in my skills enough to apply for a position as an "engineer".
I found the "Learn Enough to be Dangerous" book series by chance. I read a bit of "Learn Enough Ruby to be Dangerous" and I could immediately tell that I'd found books that if I read properly and finished with all exercises completed that I would have my portfolio (read: tangible work) and the confidence in my skills to call myself a developer at least, eventually an engineer.

Book where I got the exercises:
`Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to be Dangerous: An Introduction to Modern Website Creation and Templating Systems`

#### Top things I've learned from the book
<!-- 
  In progress.
  I'm making a commitment to myself that I'll come back and finish this README.md and specifically this section.
  I will fill this section out with insights and things i actually learned.
  It's time to actually **do the work**

1. This idea of 'Technical Sophistication'. 
The book describes it as such *"the seemingly magical ability to solve practically any technical problem"*. 

I understand technical sophisitication as an `attitude` to have towards technical material. There is a logic and rationale to how things are done. *You can figure most things out. **Believe in yourself.***
